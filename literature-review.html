    <h3>Introduction</h2>
      <p >
        A research is the process of acquiring knowledge through a careful and detailed study. In conducting a research there are many aspects that have to be done for a research to be complete. One of this aspects is the <b>Literature Review.</b>
      </p>

      <h3>Literature Review</h3>
      <p>
        Literature review is simply a background study of available researches on a particular research topic a researcher is interested in.  A literature review is a classification and assessment of available information by researchers in a field of study. This basically means you go through old and current researches to better understand you own research. A literature review enables a researcher to read before establishing or doing their own research work, it discusses published information in a particular subject area and sometimes information in a particular subject area within a period of time. Literature Review provides a new interpretation of old information, combines new with old interpretations or it might trace the intellectual progression of a field including major debates on a particular topic. A literature review is often written as part of a thesis, dissertation, or research paper, to situate the findings in relation to existing knowledge. A literature review consist of an introduction, body and a conclusion and or evaluation section. Sometimes the theoretical framework is added to the literature reviews. It is a summary of concepts and theories which researchers develops from already tested and published papers and incorporate them into their researches. This directs them on how to build a structure that defines how to go about their research.  Through literature review a researcher can widen their scope on their topic and come up with different research hypothesis to conduct a variety of researches. A research hypothesis is simply an educated guess by a researcher that has to be tested. Literature review has many benefits. This includes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Literature review gives a researcher an in-depth knowledge on the topics they want to research on and exposes gaps in research for further studies. This offers uniqueness. 
          </li>
          <li>
            It informs the reader on already found knowledge on the topics.
          </li>
          <li>
            It evaluates the sources of information and advise the researcher on the most relevant areas to focus on.
          </li>
          <li>
            It shows the relevance of the research, how the current research is going to be conducted and also helps the researcher acquire important findings that may be relevant to their research.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Introduction, Body and Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The <span class="sections">introduction</span> is an overall view of the research to be conducted which gives the reader an idea what to expect from the research. The <span class="sections">body</span> involves a discussion of academic sources to be used in in conducting the research. It includes claims and evidence which shows a researches purpose and cited knowledge from dependable sources that are needed for the research. The <span class="sections">conclusion</span> section is determined on the use of the literature review and may have an introduction to further research, discussion of gaps in earlier researches or a summary of core theories that provides the reader with a much comprehensive view on the topic.

      <h3>Types of Literature Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        A literature review is mainly a background study on available researches on a particular research topic a researcher is interested in. Some of the methods of literature review include:
        <ul>
          <li>traditional literature review</li>
          <li>systematic literature review</li>
          <li>methodological review</li>
          <li>argumentative review</li>
          <li>meta-analysis</li>
          <li>meta-synthesis</li>
        </ul> 
        A <b>traditional</b> or narrative literature reviews are narrative, comprehensive and critically analyze the weaknesses and strengths of previous researches. This aids researchers in creating a theoretical framework, identify gaps in previous studies, gives readers a good understanding of recent knowledge and shows the importance of new studies.
        <br>
        A <b>systematic</b> literature review however focuses on a much tedious, comprehensive and less narrative search process addressing literature on particular topics. This type of review focuses on verifiable questions mostly in cause and effect form. 
        <br>
        A <b>methodological</b> review is a type of review that focuses more on how a research was made rather than the findings of the research. Attention is given to the research methods which includes theories, demographics, sampling, data collection and analysis, interviews. This aids researchers identify the best theories and how the ethnography of related researches play a role the new researches. 
        <br>
        An <b>argumentative</b> reviews are background studies on selected literature on either support or disprove an argument. This type of literature reviews criticizes and commends relatable studies in a particular field of study. This sometimes causes a bias in the research.
        <br>
        The <b>meta-analysis</b> review is a review that involves a chunk of quantitative findings on particular topics which are statistically analyzed to give readers a better understanding of a research. This aids in finding patterns and connections between findings. 
        <br>
        <b>Meta-synthesis</b> reviews is the opposite of meta-analysis which is a non-statistical approach to finding, evaluating and understanding results of many qualitative researches. It involves an analysis of key elements in each study.
