    <h3>What is Research?</h2>
      <p >
        Research by definition is a careful and systematic investigation of a study regarding a particular concern or problem by the use of a scientific methods. Research is a process of systematic inquiry that involves data collection, documenting information, and analysis and interpretation of that data and information, with respect to a suitable methodology or methodologies set by academic disciplines and particular professional fields.

      <h3> Why do research?</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Research is done to solve important research topics that are beneficial to the world. 
          </li>
          <li>
            To help generate questions for further inquiries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluate the validity of a research, hypothesis or an interpretive framework

      <h3>Types of Research Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        There are many methods to conducting a research. These methods are made based on its nature, the purpose and research design of the study. Also, there are interviews and case studies based on research methodology. In most researches, researchers prefer to combine more than two methods while in some, very few methods are used for the study. Research Methods are generally grouped into <span class="section">Quantitative</span> and <span class="section">Qualitative researches</span>.
        <p>
          <ul>
            <h4>Quantitative Research</h4>
            <li>
              Quantitative Research is a type of research that involves data collection based on numbers which is analyzed and interpreted to arrive at a conclusion. This is usually represented by graphs and tables to give a better understanding of the research findings. 
            </li>
            <h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
            <li>
              Qualitative on the other hand is the opposite of a quantitative and is referred to as a non- numerical form of research which focuses on the collection and interpretation qualitative data. In some researches, not all information or data can be grasped in numerical form. An example of such a data is an interview. Note that qualitative research is not reliable as much as quantitative however, in the formation of summaries for theories this is the best method.                          
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Based on the nature of the research,</p>
          <ol>
            <h4>Descriptive  Research</h4>
            <li>
              This type of approach is used in researches about facts. This research methodology seeks to clarify facts hence its descriptive nature. Case studies and surveys can be considered types of descriptive researches. It does more of explaining than investigating and variables can be used in descriptive research to explain the facts.                          
            </li>
            <h4>Analytical  Research</h4>
            <li>
              Analytical research is a type of quantitative research methodology that focuses on already confirmed facts as the basis for their research. Data is critical evaluated in this method of research.                           
            </li>
            <p>Based on the purpose of the study,</p>
            <h4>Fundamental  Research</h4>
            <li>
              Fundamental research a type of research that investigates a theory that has never been investigated in the world yet. It is a basic or fresh research conducted to investigate an element. The conclusion is purely in common language and important findings are applied in the research or the real world.                          
            </li>
            <p>Based on research design,</p>
            <h4>Exploratory  Research</h4>
            <li>
              Conclusive Research is a research method that seeks to provide an answer to a research topic and has an organized design in its methodology. When it has a well-designed structure, it helps in generating and answering the hypotheses to results. Results from this types of research are universal and can be used in the outside world.                             
            </li>
            <h4>Conclusive  Research</h4>
            <li>
              Qualitative on the other hand is the opposite of a quantitative and is referred to as a non- numerical form of research which focuses on the collection and interpretation qualitative data. In some researches, not all information or data can be grasped in numerical form. An example of such a data is an interview. Note that qualitative research is not reliable as much as quantitative however, in the formation of summaries for theories this is the best method.                          
            </li>
            <h4>Survey Research</h4>
            <li>
              This is one of the most popular forms of conducting research and is used mainly used in research methodology. When researchers seek to collect vast amounts of data in real-time, this is the best process to use. It is less costly and is a much faster approach than other forms of methods. It can be both in quantitative and qualitative research approaches. Researchers however prefer the quantitative surveys over qualitative surveys since it provides numerical outputs and the data is real.                          
            </li>
            <h4>Case Studies</h4>
            <li>
              In a group of case studies the most suitable is chosen to be worked on.  Case studies is used to work on topics that are new as the foundation of the research. Generation of theories and facts can be derived from a case studies which will aid to form proper reviews about the research topic. A typical example of a case study is the case of Phineas Gage.
