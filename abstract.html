  <h3>Introduction</h2>
    <p >
      An abstract is a vital part of a thesis. It is often the first significant portion of a thesis that an external examiner or a researcher will read. It serves as a summary of the entire thesis and shows all the major elements of the work. It is not just a preface or an introduction to a research paper but it is also a vital part of the presentation and most readers who encounter an abstract in a catalog or email will never see the full text of the paper.
    </p>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      An abstract is between 150- to 250-word paragraph that provides readers with a quick summary of your paper or essay and its structure. It should show the central idea and your key points in the essay. The abstract must be able to accommodate the whole thesis when there is not enough time or space for the entire text and should follow the structure of the thesis. It should also represent all of the major elements of the study. The questions should form the skeleton of the abstract and should be presented at the beginning of the abstract. The main purpose of your thesis is to tell readers about the work you did. Other information, such as your methods and findings, should also be presented in order to support the claims you make.
    </p>

    <h3>Verb tenses used in abstracts</h3>
    <p>
      In <b>social science</b> researches, the researcher uses the present tense to in writing general facts and to write currently true interpretations that have statements. That researcher also describes the findings, the methods, the arguments, and its implications of the findings from their new research study using the present tense to. For previous research the researcher uses the past tense.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <b>humanities</b> researches, the researcher describes already done tasks in the past tense and uses the present tense to describe what is happening in those texts, to explain the significance or meaning of those texts, and to describe the arguments presented in the article.

    <h3>Types of abstracts</h3>
    <p>Generally there are two types of abstracts used commonly:</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Descriptive</h4>
    <p>
      A descriptive abstract is a summary of a research paper in about 100 words or less on the type of information within the article. It incorporates keywords from the article but doesn't provide the conclusions of the research.
    </p>

    <h4>Informative</h4>
    <p>
      An informative abstract on the other hand touches on everything in in a descriptive abstract but includes the results and conclusions of the research as well. The main arguments, the results and evidence that were found are included by the researcher. The length of this abstract can vary, however it is generally not more than 10% of the entire article.
    </p>
